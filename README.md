# D3 Challenge
#### This D3 application will analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand our findings. We will create an interactive Scatter chart capable of running a series of visualization about the health risks facing particular demographics.
## Here are some of the core features of this application: -
#### All visualizations are at the state level. The state Abbreviation will appear at the center of each circle
#### The X-Axis will feature Poverty %, Age and Median Income 
#### The Y-Axis will feature No Healthcare %, Smokers % and Obesity %
#### Users will be able to click on any Axis label and dynamically plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age etc.
#### To enhance the visualization, we will rotate through three different colors based on data selection
#### Users may hover over a scatter plot circle to display corresponding tooltips with exact data points
